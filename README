RockBand StageKit API
Linux support libraries for the PDP Rock Band Stage Kit, including full control over the strobe, fog, and LED lights.
-----------------------------

USAGE:
    To use the API, simply put the stagekit.h and stagekit.c files in the relevant spot of your project directory,
#include them, and then issue an sk_init(char *filename) where filename is the location of the appropriate event file
(such as /dev/input/event5), and then use any of the other commands according to what you want to do.

sk_init(filename)
    Open an event interface file for a stage kit. If set to NULL, the API will attempt to probe for one automatically.

sk_close()
    Closes the file handles for the stage kit.

sk_alloff()
    Sends a "panic" signal to turn everything off at once.

sk_setstrobe(speed)
    Set strobe flash speed. Valid range 0-4.

sk_setfog(fog)
    Turn the fogger on or off.

sk_setred(red)
    Set the red LEDs according to the first 8 bits of input, where each bit represents a single LED.

sk_setyellow(yellow)
    Set the yellow LEDs according to the first 8 bits of input, where each bit represents a single LED.

sk_setgreen(green)
    Set the green LEDs according to the first 8 bits of input, where each bit represents a single LED.

sk_setblue(blue)
    Set the blue LEDs according to the first 8 bits of input, where each bit represents a single LED.
